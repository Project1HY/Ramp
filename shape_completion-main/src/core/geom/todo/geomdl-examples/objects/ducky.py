"""
    Plotting the Duck Example from GLScene with NURBS-Python

    GLScene: http://wiki.freepascal.org/GLScene
    GLScene on GitHub: https://github.com/cutec-chris/GLScene

    The "Ducky" example contains 3 surfaces. The surface data is accessible via the "GLScene on GitHub" link above in
    the directory "Demos/media/" with the file names "duck1.nurbs", "duck2.nurbs" and "duck3.nurbs". The contents of
    these files are extracted into NURBS-Python format.

    The main difference between the surface exchange is the row order. Most of the time it affects the evaluation result.
    It is easy to understand the issues caused by the row order: Using a 1-dimensional array of control points in the
    wrong order may cause a "hole" or leave some regions unevaluated. For the 2-dimensional array of control points,
    most of the time you will get an IndexError exception.

    NURBS-Python uses v-row order but GLScene uses u-row order (please see docs for more details on the row order).
    This means that u- and v-directions of the *.nurbs files must be transposed (or flipped) in order to get the
    correct shapes. This example fixes the issues caused by the row order difference.
